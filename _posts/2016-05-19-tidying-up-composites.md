"What a mess!" This was the first reaction of one renowned researcher to the X-ray µ-tomography reconstruction of a composite reinforced with short natural fibers. He followed with "It should be put in order" and then wandered in the distance. It was indeed quite difficult to make out anything out of the picture as you can see here

As I'm an avid fan of art, a proper classification of this figure followed: organic 3D Jackson Pollock. Can be a pleasure to the eye, but is not necessarily easy to comprehend and analyze. What can we do? The TED talk by Ursus Wehrli might provide a clue: https://www.ted.com/talks/ursus\_wehrli\_tidies\_up\_art?language=en

His solution for Jackson Pollock-like paintings in our case would be equivalent to summing up the volume fractions of each phase in the material giving:
![Composite material decomposed: polymer matrix accounts for 97% of the volume, short natural fibers are the remaining 3%.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/816aa655-ba83-4ce4-8964-a068287aee39.jpg)

This seems much easier to understand, and the fibers are also color-coded and separated: starting with the small ones and finishing on the ones with much more complex morphology.
