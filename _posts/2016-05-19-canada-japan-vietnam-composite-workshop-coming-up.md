description: 'Accurate reconstruction of the complex geometry of woven reinforcement in composites is a principal requirement for numerical simulations of material manufacture, especially of textile compression and impregnation. Volume imaging techniques like X-ray microtomography provide information on realistic geometry but require optimization to be efficient in practical applications. We propose a dual kriging-based method for reconstructing the continuous model of the textile reinforcement applied to data extracted from micro-tomographic scans. The accuracy of the model is regulated by the force of the nugget effect and the discretization scheme based on curvature energy of the fiber tow cross-section diminishing the memory requirements by a factor of 500 compared to the initial X-ray scan.'

Accurate reconstruction of the complex geometry of woven reinforcement in composites is a principal requirement for numerical simulations of material manufacture, especially of textile compression and impregnation. Volume imaging techniques like X-ray microtomography provide information on realistic geometry but require optimization to be efficient in practical applications. We propose a dual kriging-based method for reconstructing the continuous model of the textile reinforcement applied to data extracted from micro-tomographic scans. The accuracy of the model is regulated by the force of the nugget effect and the discretization scheme based on curvature energy of the fiber tow cross-section diminishing the memory requirements by a factor of 500 compared to the initial X-ray scan.
